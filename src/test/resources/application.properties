# Your media directory:
mediaregistry.directory=/home/media/
# The scan depth - that is the number of directories stacked into each other:
mediaregistry.max.scanner.depth=10
# List of media file suffixes to include in scanning:
mediaregistry.suffixList=.mp4, .mkv, .vib
# Be careful: Setting threads to n will start n md5sum processes on your system.
# As md5sum is heavily reading from your harddisk or SDD you should not set the value too high: 
mediaregistry.threads=1
# The path of the md5sum command:
mediaregistry.md5sum.command=/usr/bin/md5sum
# Use binary scanning:
mediaregistry.md5sum.parameters=-b
# The path of the rm command:
mediaregistry.rm.command=/bin/rm
